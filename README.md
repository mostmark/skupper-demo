# Skupper demo

This demo shows some of the capabilities in [Skupper](https://skupper.io) and is split into three parts:

  - [Part1](./demo-scripts/part1-hybrid-cloud.md) shows how you can set up an application with two services deployed in two different OpenShift clusters.
  
  - [Part2](./demo-scripts/part1-hybrid-cloud.md) shows resiliency and loadbalincing capabilities in Skupper
  
  - [Part3](./demo-scripts/part3-private-database.md) shows how you can deploy an application in a public cluster that communicates with a MySQL database running in a RHEL instance on a private network. This part can be run standalone or be build on top of part 1 and 2.
